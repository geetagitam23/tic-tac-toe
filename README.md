Project Report: Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax
Introduction
The Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax is a Python-based project that implements an artificial intelligence opponent for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, providing an engaging and challenging gaming experience for players.

Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are as follows:

Create a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player can compete against an AI opponent.
Implement the minimax algorithm to enable the AI to make optimal moves and never lose.
Provide a simple and intuitive interface for the player to interact with the game through the command prompt.
Implementation
Game Logic
The game is implemented using a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Players take turns marking empty cells with their respective symbols: "X" for the human player and "O" for the AI. The game continues until one of the players wins by forming a line of three symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or if the board is filled with no winner (a tie).

Minimax Algorithm
The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make its decisions. The minimax algorithm is a recursive search algorithm that explores all possible game states to find the best move for the AI. It assigns scores to each possible move, and the AI selects the move with the highest score when it is its turn.

User Interaction
The player interacts with the game through the command prompt. They input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their "X." The game provides feedback on the current state of the board, AI moves, and the game's outcome.

Code Structure
The project code is organized into the following functions:

print_board(board): Displays the current state of the game board.
is_winner(board, player): Checks if a player has won the game.
is_board_full(board): Checks if the game board is completely filled.
minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing): Implements the minimax algorithm to find the best move for the AI.
find_best_move(board): Calls minimax to determine the best move for the AI.
log_game_state(board): Logs the current state of the game board.
log_game_outcome(winner): Logs the game outcome.
log_player_move(row, col): Logs the player's moves.
log_ai_move(row, col): Logs the AI's moves.
log_invalid_move(): Logs when the player makes an invalid move.
log_game_start(): Logs the start of the game.
log_game_end(): Logs the end of the game.
Usage
To play the game, run the Python script in your command prompt. The game starts by displaying the empty game board, and the player can input their moves by specifying the row and column numbers. The AI makes its moves using the minimax algorithm, and the game continues until there is a winner or a tie.

Conclusion
The Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax project successfully implements a playable game where a human player can compete against an AI opponent. The minimax algorithm ensures that the AI makes optimal moves, making it challenging for the player to win. This project serves as a simple yet engaging introduction to game AI and demonstrates the power of the minimax algorithm in decision-making.

Future Enhancements
Future enhancements for this project could include:

Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
Adding difficulty levels to the AI, allowing players to choose between easy, medium, and hard AI opponents.
Extending the game to support larger grid sizes (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5) for increased complexity.
Overall, the Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax project serves as a foundation for more advanced game AI development and provides valuable insights into the world of artificial intelligence in gaming.
